is proud to host a Pop-Up Mentoring Program (PUMP) event. PUMP (sponsored by the LSA Committee on Gender Equity) provides on-site, one-off mentoring meetings at linguistics conferences around the world. PUMP matches one or more mentees with mentors who can provide quick but personalized career advice to linguists at any stage, in any location, and in any career: anyone can be a mentee or mentor, the more the merrier.
 
You can register as a mentee here, and as a mentor here. We almost always have a lot of mentee interest so we especially encourage relatively senior linguists to apply as mentors if they think they can. The deadline for registering as a mentee or a mentor for this event is [DEADLINE].  After you register, you will receive an email matching you with your mentor or mentee, with details about how to meet. Please email Jessica Rett (rett@ucla.edu) with any questions about the PUMP event.
